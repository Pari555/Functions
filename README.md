## Functions
A function is a group of related statements that performs a specific task.
Fuctions help us breakdown our program into sections.

### DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself

### Formula:
```python
def functionName(optional parameters):
	#BODY
	#Optional 'return' statements
```

To use a fuction, we have to __call__ it
`functionName(optional parameters)`
